Section 1: Overview of the Training Plan

- Time analysis: There are 48 weeks available from 2025-08-23 to 2026-07-26.
- Goal assessment: Your current longest run is 9.4 km, with a running frequency of 1–2 times per week (occasionally 3–4 per month). This provides a solid aerobic base but requires a gradual increase in frequency and distance to safely reach 21.1 km.
- Running frequency: Based on recent Strava data, you average 1–2 runs per week, with some months reaching 3 runs/week. The plan will progressively build to 3–4 runs per week.
- Training phases:
  - Base Building (Weeks 1–16): 2–3 runs/week
  - Build Phase (Weeks 17–32): 3–4 runs/week
  - Peak Phase (Weeks 33–42): 4 runs/week
  - Taper (Weeks 43–48): 3 runs/week

Section 3: Additional Analysis and Notes

- Race-specific preparation:
  - Terrain: If your half marathon is on road, prioritize road running for long runs and race simulations. If mixed or trail, include similar terrain in training.
  - Pacing: Practice goal half marathon pace in peak phase long runs and tempo sessions. Use a GPS watch or Strava for pacing feedback.
  - Equipment: Train in the shoes and gear you plan to use on race day. Test nutrition (gels, drinks) during long runs and simulations.
  - Mental strategies: Use race simulations to practice positive self-talk, visualization, and dealing with discomfort.

- Risk assessment & feasibility:
  - This plan is designed for safe, progressive adaptation, with down weeks every 4th week and gradual increases in long run distance.
  - The frequency and intensity ramp up slowly, respecting your current 1–2 runs/week baseline.
  - Potential risks: If you experience persistent pain, fatigue, or illness, reduce volume/intensity and consult a professional.
  - Feasibility: With consistency and adherence to rest/recovery, you are well-positioned to complete the plan and achieve your 21.1 km goal.

**You are set up for success with this periodized, progressive, and purpose-driven training plan. Stay consistent, listen to your body, and enjoy the journey to your half marathon!**
