Section 1: Overview of the Training Plan

- Time analysis: There are 48 weeks between 2025-08-25 and 2026-07-26.
- Goal assessment: Your recent running history (1–2 runs/week, longest run 9.4 km, most runs 2–5 km) indicates a low but consistent base. You have sufficient time to safely build to a half marathon (21.1 km) with a progressive plan.
- Running frequency: Based on recent Strava data, your average is 0.8 runs/week over 6 months, trending up to 1–2 runs/week in recent weeks.
- Training phases:
    - Base (Weeks 1–12): 3→4 runs/week
    - Build (Weeks 13–32): 4–5 runs/week
    - Peak (Weeks 33–44): 4–5 runs/week
    - Taper (Weeks 45–48): 3–4 runs/week

Section 3: Additional Analysis and Notes

- Race-specific preparation:
    - Terrain: Train on routes similar to your goal race (surface, elevation). Include some long runs on the actual course if possible.
    - Pacing: Practice goal half marathon pace during tempo and long runs, especially in the final 12 weeks.
    - Equipment: Use race shoes and gear during long runs and simulation runs. Practice fueling (gels, hydration) on long runs.
- Risk assessment & feasibility:
    - This plan is highly feasible given your timeline and gradual progression. The 48-week structure allows for adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention.
    - Risks: Main risks are overuse injuries if progression is rushed, or if recovery is neglected. Listen to your body, adjust as needed, and prioritize sleep, nutrition, and cross-training.
    - If you miss a week due to illness or life events, resume at a slightly reduced volume and rebuild gradually.
    - If you experience persistent pain, reduce intensity/volume and consult a professional.

You are set up for a successful, enjoyable half marathon journey. Stay consistent, trust the process, and celebrate your progress along the way!
